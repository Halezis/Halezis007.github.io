Group 136 SideHustleNG Capstone Project 

My name is Halezis, I'm the team lead for the HTML, CSS and Javascript(Group 136) and this is our solution for the SideHustleNg Capstone Project. 
First off, we found it difficult coming together as group due to an inefficient communication avenue, although this was sorted with the creation of the telegram group. 

Our goal was to work on the project together as a team, and learn from each other, as we had a mix of newbies and a couple of others at the intermediate level of HTML and CSS. 
Every group member was asked to attempt building the project on their own, then submit to the team, while we review and select the best to submit. We also helped each other clear doubts arising from working on the project, also on HTML and CSS in general.

Here are the members who actively participated in the completion of the project.
